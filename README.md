# The Proxinator

The Proxinator is a peer-to-peer network proxy service, which relays network connections through a subset of peers. Planned features are encrypted P2P messaging (currently using the [Wendy DHT](https://github.com/secondbit/wendy)) and creating encrypted "virtual circuits" through peers using which network connections can be proxied.
