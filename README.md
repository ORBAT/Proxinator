# The Proxinator

The Proxinator is a peer-to-peer HTTP proxy service, which relays encrypted HTTP requests through a subset of network participants so the requests exit the network at different nodes. It offers no anonymity and no strong guarantees about secrecy, beyond encrypting the requests so that only the exit node can decrypt them.
